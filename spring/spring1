Spring FrameWork:
	* Java spring framework is an open source framework that provides all infrastructure needs for the rapid development of standard and enterprise java applications .
	* Develop by Rod Johnson in Feb 2003
	* Features
		Powerful open source
		Lightweight applications framework
		Reduces overall complexity
		framework of frameworks
		Distinct division between javaBean models, controllers, views
		Spring MVC is very flexible as it makes use of interface
		Layered architecture, loose coupling
		Support for REST style web services.
		Support for dependency injection which means all the required dependencies will be resolved with the help of containers .
		Support for interaction with database.
	
Spring Modules:	
	Core Containers – Includes Beans, Core, Context and SpEL modules
	Data Access/Integration- includes JDBC, ORM, OXM, JMS and Transactions modules
	Web- Includes Web Socket, Servlet, Web and Portlet modules
	AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
	Instrumentation
	Messaging
	Test
	
Dependency Injection (DI):	
	Dependency Injection is at the heart of the Spring framework.
	The basic concept of the Dependency Injection is that framework provides the dependencies of class itself.
	We need not create the objects instead we just define how they should be created and IoC container will create the objects for us.
	e.g. => if we have two classes ‘ClassA’ and ‘ClassB’. ClassA is dependent on ClassB 
			then container will inject the instance of ClassB in an instance of ClassA.
			
Spring Framework Architecture:
	Spring Framework is a layered or modular architecture. 
	There are around 20 modules and applications need to deploy/use only required modules.

Spring Core Container:
	1) Spring Core: as par name it is core module of spring, provides implementation of several features including IoC(Inversion of Control).
					IoC also known of dependency injection.
	2) Spring Beans: Module provides the implementation of BeanFactory.
	3) Spring Context: Spring core and spring beans modules are the foundation of context module.
					   this provides the implementation of Application context which is mean to access object in a framework-style manner.
					   Context module inherits its features from the Beans module and adds support for other features like internationalization,events,propagation etc.
	4) SpEL: Spring Expression Language
			  This module is an extension to expression language supported by Java server pages and also represented as SpEL. 
			  This modules helps in achieving dynamic behavior.

Spring Data Access and  Integration:
	1) Transaction: The transaction module provides supports programmatic and declarative transaction management that provides benefits like 
					Consistent programming model across different transaction APIs such as Java Transaction API (JTA), JDBC, Hibernate, 
					Java Persistence API (JPA), and Java Data Objects (JDO).
					Simpler API for programmatic transaction management than complex transaction APIs such as JTA.
	2) OXM (Object/XML Mapping): This module provides an abstraction layer that supports Object/XML mapping implementations such as JAXB,  XMLBeans, JiBX
	3) ORM ( Object Relationship Mapping): this module supports the integration of application with other ORM frameworks like JPA, JDO, and Hibernate.
	4) JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): We all have used JDBC somewhere to connect to the database and repetitive code need to be written every time.
					The module is kind of wrapper on JDBC which eliminates the need to repetitive and unnecessary exception handling overhead
	5) JMS (Java Messaging Service): The  JMS module (Java Messaging Service) includes features for sending and receiving messages between many clients			
	
Spring Web:
	1) Web- The web module provides support for features like file upload , webapplication-context  implementation etc.
	2) Servlet– This module is also known as spring-web-mvc module and provides  M V C implementation for web applications.
	3) Portlet- This module is also known as spring-webmvc-portlet module provides the support for Spring based Portlets
	
Test: 
	This module provides support of  the unit testing and integration testing with other testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG.
